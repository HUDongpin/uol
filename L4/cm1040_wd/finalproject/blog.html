							<h2 class="blog-post-title">How Asian Americans Are Thinking About The 2020 Election</h2>
							<p class="blog-post-meta">SEP. 18, 2020, 7:00 AM</p>

							<p>Republicans have made some inroads in the past four years.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Poll of the week</h2>
							<p>
								Asian American voters didn’t always lean Democratic. In 1992, less than a third of Asian Americans voted Democratic. But nowadays,
								most Asian Americans identify as Democrats, with more than half saying they plan to back Joe Biden and less than a third saying they’d
								vote for President Trump, according to the latest Asian American Voter Survey released this week. Asian American voters are hardly a
								monolith. The different groups that comprise Asian American voters are divided over how much — and whether — they will back Biden for
								president. For instance, Filipino Americans are more evenly divided among supporting Biden and Trump than Japanese Americans. And
								Indian Americans, who have been reliably Democratic for years, now show some signs of slowly shifting to the right. Finally,
								Vietnamese Americans lean pretty consistently Republican.

							<h2 class="blog-post-title">Democrats Are Slight Favorites To Take Back The Senate</h2>
							<p class="blog-post-meta">SEP. 17, 2020, 4:32 AM</p>

							<hr />
							<p>
								Democrats are slight favorites to regain control of the Senate, according to the FiveThirtyEight Senate forecast, which launched
								today. But the map is wide open, with at least a dozen competitive races — none of which are certain pickups for Democrats — including
								some states where Democrats are playing defense. In fact, while it’s possible that Democrats will wind up controlling 54 seats or
								perhaps even more, the most likely outcome is a much more closely divided chamber, including the possibility of a 50/50 split in which
								control of the Senate would be determined by whether the vice president is Kamala Harris or Mike Pence. (Joe Biden and Harris
								currently have a 76 percent chance of winning the presidential race, according to our forecast.)

							<h2 class="blog-post-title">North Carolina Is Already Rejecting Black Voters’ Mail-In Ballots More Often Than White Voters’</h2>
							<p class="blog-post-meta">SEP. 15, 2020, 2:04 PM</p>

							<hr />
							<p>
								In every election, a small percentage of mail-in ballots get rejected. But this election is likely to have a whole lot of mail-in
								ballots. And in an election where a record number of voters are expected to cast their ballots by mail, you’re likely to hear a whole
								lot about ballots that don’t count, especially because voters of color have ballots rejected at a higher rate than white voters. It’s
								already happening. In North Carolina, absentee ballots have already been sent back and the state has been updating statistics on those
								ballots daily. As of September 17, Black voters’ ballots are being rejected at more than four times the rate of white voters,
								according to the state’s numbers.1 Black voters have mailed in 13,747 ballots, with 642 rejected, or 4.7 percent. White voters have
								cast 60,954 mail-in ballots, with 681 — or 1.1 percent — rejected. In addition, 434 ballots cast by white voters and 127 ballots cast
								by Black voters were marked “spoiled,” which can mean literally spoiled or something as simple as a voter informing the election
								office that the address they had requested a ballot to is wrong. (These are a tiny portion of the votes from one state, so obviously
								we have a long way to go before we know the full landscape of ballot rejection rates.)
