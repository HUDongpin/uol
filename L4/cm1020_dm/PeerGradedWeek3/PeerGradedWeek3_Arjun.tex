% Preamble: 
\section*{Question 1}

We can show a function \( A \rightarrow B \)  to be injective by showing that if \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) \) for arbtirary \( x_1, x_2 \in A \), then \( x_1 = x_2 \). We can disprove it by showing that more than one function value is possible for a given element.

We can show a function \( A \rightarrow B \) to be surjective by showing that for an arbitrary element \( y \in B \) there is an element \( x \in A \) such that \( f(x) = y \). We can disprove it by finding an element that does not have a function value.

\paragraph{Function 1} To show that the function \[
f_1: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ where } f(x) = x^2 + 1  
\]
is injective, we see if \( f(x) = f(y) \) for arbtirary \( x_1, x_2 \in A \), then \( x = y \).

\begin{align}
  {x_1}^2 + 1 &= {x_2}^2 + 1 \\
  {x_1}^2 &= {x_2}^2 \\
  \pm x_1 &= \pm x_2
\end{align}

Therefore \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) and the function is \textbf{not injective}. For example: \( x_1 = -2, x_2 = 2 \) and \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 4 \). The function is \textbf{not surjective} as there exist elements in the co-domain that do not have a function value \( f(x) \), for example \( f(x) = -2 \).    

\paragraph{Function 2} The function \[
  f_2: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \interval[open right]{-1}{\infty} \text{ where } f(x) = x^2 + 1
  \]
is \textbf{not injective} as per the reasoning for function \( f_1 \). 
As the co-domain is restricted to positive real numbers, The function is \textbf{surjective} as there exist pre-images \( x \) for any \( f(x) \).

\paragraph{Function 3} The function 
\[
  f_2: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \text{ where } f(x) = x^3
\]

can be shown to be \textbf{injective} as it is a \textbf{strictly increasing} and \textbf{real-valued} function. Therefore for any given \( x_1, x_2 \) we know that \( f(x_1) \neq f(x_2) \). The plot for this function is shown in \autoref{plots1}. The function is \textbf{surjective} as \( f(x) \) is defined for any \( x \).

\paragraph{Function 4} The function \[
  f_2: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \interval[open right]{-1}{\infty} \text{ where } f(x) = 2x + 3
\]

is \textbf{injective} because it is a \textbf{strictly increasing} and \textbf{real-valued} function. For each \( x \) there is a unique \( f(x) \) in the co-domain. The function is \textbf{surjective} as \( f(x) \) is defined for any \( x \).

\paragraph{Function 5} The function \[
  f_2: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} \text{ where } f(x) = 2x + 3
\]

is \textbf{injective} because it is a \textbf{strictly increasing} and \textbf{integer-valued} function. For each \( x \) there is a unique \( f(x) \) in the co-domain. The function is \textbf{not surjective} as \( f(x) \) is not defined for any \( x \), for example \( f(1) \) is not defined in the co-domain \( \mathbb{Z} \).

\section*{Question 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The function \( f_2: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \interval[open]{-1}{\infty} \text{ where } f(x) = e^x + 1 \) is a bijection if it is both injective and surjective. It is injective because it is \textbf{strictly increasing} and each \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) has a unique \( f(x) \in \mathbb{R} \).
  \item  The inverse of the function is given as follows: \begin{align}
    f^-1 = e^y + 1 &= x \\
    e^y &= x-1 \\
    \ln(e^y) &= \ln(x-1) \\
    y &= \ln(x-1)
  \end{align}

  \item The plots are given in \autoref{plots2}.
  \item The graphs are both strictly increasing. The graph of \( f \) is exponential growth, while the graph of \( f^-1 \) is logarithmic growth. The graphs are symmetric.
\end{enumerate}
