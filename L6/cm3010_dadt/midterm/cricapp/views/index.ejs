				<h1>CricApp</h1>
				<p>
					This small application displays basic queries against a
					database of Cricket match data obtained from
					<a href="https://cricsheet.org/matches/">CricSheet</a>. The following sections outline some interesting questions we aimed to ask this dataset.
				</p>

        <h2>Most matches played by a team</h2>
        <p>What are the test-playing nations in our dataset, and how many matches has each of them played?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It's clear that the traditional nations such as England and Australia have played far more matches than other teams</li>
          <li>New countries who have become test playing nations in recent countries rank at the bottom (Afghanistan, Ireland)</li>
          <li>There has been a match where an "ICC World XI" played. This match was played against <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-world-xi-tour-of-australia-2005-06-208890/australia-vs-icc-world-xi-only-test-221840/full-scorecard" target="_blank">Australia in 2005</a>. </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Even though the dataset includes women's cricket, none of the top batters are women</li>
          <li>Because the data starts at 2004, some of the best batsmen of all time such as SR Tendulkar or Ricky Ponting do not appear near the top of the list.</li>

        <!-- Question 4 -->

        <h2>Most common dismissals</h2>
        <p>What is the most common type of dismissal since 2004?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Catches are by far the most common type of dismissal. This includes catches from the wicket-keeper.</li>
          <li>Interestingly, not a single instance of "handling the ball" was recorded, which is an offense by the batsman that can lead to a dismissal.</li>
