	abstract = {We review the main components of autonomous scientific discovery, and how they lead to the concept of a Robot Scientist. This is a system which uses techniques from artificial intelligence to automate all aspects of the scientific discovery process: it generates hypotheses from a computer model of the domain, designs experiments to test these hypotheses, runs the physical experiments using robotic systems, analyses and interprets the resulting data, and repeats the cycle. We describe our two prototype Robot Scientists: Adam and Eve. Adam has recently proven the potential of such systems by identifying twelve genes responsible for catalysing specific reactions in the metabolic pathways of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This work has been formally recorded in great detail using logic. We argue that the reporting of science needs to become fully formalised and that Robot Scientists can help achieve this. This will make scientific information more reproducible and reusable, and promote the integration of computers in scientific reasoning. We believe the greater automation of both the physical and intellectual aspects of scientific investigations to be essential to the future of science. Greater automation improves the accuracy and reliability of experiments, increases the pace of discovery and, in common with conventional laboratory automation, removes tedious and repetitive tasks from the human scientist.},

	abstract = {Most research on inductive learning has been concerned with qualitative learning that induces conceptual, logic-style descriptions from the given facts. In contrast, quantitative learning deals with discovering numerical laws characterizing empirical data. This research attempts to integrate both types of learning by combining newly developed heuristics for formulating equations with the previously developed concept learning method embodied in the inductive learning program AQ11. The resulting system, ABACUS, formulates equations that bind subsets of observed data, and derives explicit, logicstyle descritions stating the applicability conditions for these equations. In addition, several new techniques for quantitative learning are introduced. Units analysis reduces the search space of equations by examining the compatibility of variables' units. Proportionality graph search addresses the problem of identifying relevant variables that should enter equations. Suspension search focusses the search space through heuristic evaluation. The capabilities of ABACUS are demonstrated by several examples from physics and chemistry.},

We characterize five historical stages of the scientific discovery process, which we use as an organizational framework in describing applications. We also identify five distinct steps during which developers or users can influence the behavior of a computational discovery system. Rather than criticizing such intervention, as done in the past, we recommend it as the preferred approach to using discovery software. As evidence for the advantages of such human-computer cooperation, we report seven examples of novel, computer-aided discoveries that have appeared in the scientific literature, along with the role that humans played in each case. We close by recommending that future systems provide more explicit support for human intervention in the discovery process.},

The problem of representation for problem solving systems is discussed. Various centers of excellence in the artificial intelligence research area is mentioned.
