\subsection{Types of Machine Learning}

In most cases where machine learning is used, we don't know what the actual problem is. There are two types of ML problems.

\paragraph{Supervised learning} The agent observes input-output pairs and learns a \textit{function} that maps from input to output. The outputs (``answers'') provided are called \textbf{labels}.

Given a training set of \(N\) example input-output pairs
\[
(x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2),...(x_n, y_n)
\]

where each pair was generated by an unknown function \(y = f(x)\), discover a function \(h\) that approximates the true function \(f\), stated as 
\[
h(x) \rightarrow y    
\]


Essentially, we provide the ``answers'' to the problem as inputs, and the AI system comes up with the ``rules''.

The outputs can be \textbf{discrete}, for example a classification into a specific group, or \textbf{continuous}, for example predicting a specific price.

\paragraph{Unsupervised learning} The agent only receives data but no labels, and is tasked with finding meaningful representations of the data with a variety of techniques.

\paragraph{textbf}{Reinforcement learning} The agent gets a reward for completing a desired outcome, making the agent better over time.

\subsubsection{Types of algorithms}

Depending on the problem, different algorithms are suitable to be used by an agent.

\paragraph{Regression} When predicting a continuous variable.

\paragraph{Classification} When predicting a discrete output, such as assigning data to groups.

\paragraph{Clustering} When identifying new groupings of data in an unsupervised scenario.

\subsection{Machine Learning Black Box}

A typical machine learning pipeline involves taking a set of \textbf{labels} \(Y\) and a set of \textbf{data} \(X\), which the agent processes into a \textbf{mapping} of \(X\) to \(Y\). This mapping can then be used to map new data to a prediction.

Within the agent, data is often taken through \textbf{feature pre-processing} before reaching the ML algorithm, which is fed with the labels.

\subsection{Deep Learning}

A subset of ML, \textbf{deep learning} is an approach to learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning \textit{successive layers} of increasingly meaningful representations.

In deep learning, these layered representations are (almost always) learned via models called \textit{neural networks}.

\end{figure}

The specification of what each layer does is encoded in \textit{weights}, also called the \textit{parametrization} of the layers. These are initially assigned at random.

The \textbf{loss function} or cost function takes the predictions of the agent, compares them to the true targets and generates a \textit{loss score}.

This score is used by the \textbf{optimizer}, which implements a \textbf{Backpropagatgion algorithm} to adjust the weights and improve the model.
